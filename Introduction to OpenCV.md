## <u>What is OpenCV?</u>

OpenCV stands for Open-Source Computer Vision (Library). It is the most common and popularly used, well-documented Computer Vision library. OpenCV is an open-source library that incorporates numerous computer vision algorithms. OpenCV increases computational efficiency and assists with real-time applications. One of the major goals of OpenCV is to provide an accessible and easy-to-use computer vision infrastructure that helps people build sophisticated computer vision applications quickly.

## <u>Features of OpenCV</u>

Main features of OpenCV-Python include:

1. **Cross-platform**: Allows installation for different environments (operating systems)
2. **Portable**: Transferable to any machine that can run C.
3. **Open source**: OpenCV is free for use under the open-source Apache 2 License.
4. **Fast**: OpenCV is highly optimized and makes use of NumPy functions.
5. **Vast algorithms**: OpenCV packages contain more than 2500 algorithms.
6. **Fast prototyping:** Implemented in the development of real-time applications.
7. **Extensive use**: Used across various organizations and companies.

## <u>Context</u>

OpenCV was initiated at Intel in the year 1999 by Gary Bradsky. The first release of OpenCV came later in the year 2000. It was originally developed by Intel employees in a research center in Russia, but the project was taken over by a non-profit organization in 2012. OpenCV supports a multitude of Computer Vision and Machine Learning algorithms that are ever-growing.

In the initial stages of OpenCV, the goals of the company were as follows:

1. They sought to make advanced computer vision more accessible by providing open and optimized code for computer vision implementation.
2. The company aimed to essential open-source computer vision knowledge by providing a common platform that developers could build on, to make the code readily readable and transferable.
3. Deliver advanced commercial applications of computer vision by making portable and optimized code available for development. The OpenCVâ€™s license provided the developers with the freedom to choose whether to open-source their product or not.

## <u>Quality attribute</u>

1. Usablity. OpenCV supports a wide range of programming languages which include C++, Java, Python, etc. This is a cross-platform library that supports Windows, Linux, macOS, Android, and iOS.
2. Performance. OpenCV is a highly optimized library with focus on real-time applications.
3. Scalability. OpenCV now supports many algorithms related to computer vision and machine learning, and it is expanding every day.
4. Cross-platform. OpenCV has C++, Python and Java interfaces support Linux, MacOS, Windows, iOS, and Android.

## <u>Key Driver</u> 

1. Cross-platform

The key design idea is to keep pipeline code itself platform-neutral while specifying which kernels to use and which devices to utilize using extra parameters at graph compile (configuration) time.

2. Performance

 It plays a major role in real-time image processing and computer vision tasks which is a necessity for modern applications. OpenCV makes use of NumPy, which is a highly optimized python library for numerical computations. All of the OpenCV array structures are converted to and from NumPy arrays.

3. Usability

Users can use algorithm in openCV quickly and efficiently through calling function and giving parameters.

## <u>Early Decision</u> 

1. To make openCV Cross-platform,  openCV was written in C and this makes OpenCV portable to almost any commercial system.
2. To make openCV Cross-platform, openCV use a wrapper on top of dynamically loaded OpenCL runtime, so-called Transparent API (T-API).
3. OpenCV has many component: core, imgproc, object detection, features2d, calib3dstereo, and other modules. 
4. To make openCV easier to use, openCV design class MAT to achieve reference counting mechanism to automate memory management.

## <u>Technical Context</u>  

1. Usibility. The lack of a computer vision library makes the development process require additional development.
2. Scalability. More and more computer vision algorithms have been proposed, which demands the scalability of the software. In commercial software, due to limitation of the interface, and it is difficult to expand flexibly according to the requirements.

## <u>Key Driver Senario</u>

1. Performance

   source: user

   stimulus: smooth a picture

   environment: normal operation

   artifact: imgproc module (image processing module)

   response: return the correct result in time

   response measure: the time spent to smooth the picture should be less than 1s.

2. usibility

   source: user

   stimulus:  sharpen an image

   artifact: imgproc module (image processing module)

   environment: running time

   response: return the image result 

   response measure:  the proccessed image is highly close to the expectaion.

## <u>**Architecture Tactics**</u>

1. Performance: Use concurrent

OpenCV has designed a uniform set of vector instructions(universal intrinsics), which can mask the differences between the different instruction sets. It allows you to write a piece of code for vector acceleration on different platforms and instruction sets. 

OpenCV Universal Intrinsic encapsulates the vectors (vector) of the different SIMD instructions into a unified data structure, overloading the various operators, and describes the vector width as a variable that automatically changes with the compiled environment.

2. Performance: Reduce Overhead 

OpenCV designed class GMat. Instead of storing the actual data, it records what the user does on the GMat and eventually combines multiple GMat to generate a computational graph to handle the real calculation. GMat can provide cross-function optimization that cannot be provided by decentralized functions internally, such as the merger of arithmetic operations, multiplexing of cache and avoid multiple allocation of buffers.
